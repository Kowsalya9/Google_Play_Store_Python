Tasks

1. Visualize the sentiment distribution (positive, neutral, negative) of user reviews using a stacked bar chart, segmented by rating groups (e.g., 1-2 stars, 3-4 stars, 4-5 stars). Include only apps with more than 1,000 reviews and group by the top 5 categories.

2. Create a dual-axis chart comparing the average installs and revenue for free vs. paid apps within the top 3 app categories. Apply filters to exclude apps with fewer than 10,000 installs and revenue below $10,000 and android version should be more than 4.0 as well as size should be more than 15M and content rating should be Everyone and app name should not have more than 30 characters including space and special character.

3. Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of ratings for each app category, but only include categories with more than 50 apps and app name should contain letter “C” and exclude apps with fewer than 10 reviews and rating should be less 4.0. This graph should not work between 6 PM to 11PM.
